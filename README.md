# MVM
MVM or Metaverse Virtual Meet is a project built to create a new way fun way for attending meetings, the main core goal of the project is to create a project like Zoom or Google Meet, but the main difference is that you will attend the meetings with your own customized generated avatar instead of you real face, and this avatar will follow your face motion and expression. 

This process will make the meeting more fun, and on the other hand, it will make it easier to attend the meetings with a bad internet connection 
because in our case, we are not sending a video stream to the server, instead we are sending only some values that describe the changing of the facial motion and expression
